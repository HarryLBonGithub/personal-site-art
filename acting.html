                        Harry was living, working, and performing in Milwaukee Wisconsin for 
                        almost ten years before moving to Guelph Ontario. He worked on the film 
                        Baraboo which released in 2009, graduated from Marquette University 
                        with a B.A. in theater studies in 2011, and has worked with Milwaukee 
                        theater companies like Pink Banana and The Alchemist since then. Most 
                        recently he had a blast performing with the sketch comedy group 
                        Variety Hour Happy Hour, in shows like Stars War: One Magic Sithmas. When 
                        he's got time to himself, he works on self produced animated projects like 
                        the web series Space Station-19 and series pilot Most Fowl. Outside of 
                        acting, Harry enjoys playing music, dabbling in game 
                        design, and practicing web development.
